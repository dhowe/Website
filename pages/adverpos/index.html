      <p>There was a time, however brief, when the web was a space largely free of commerce and capitalism. Today,
        however, our online actions are tracked by sophisticated automated systems ("robots") that mine our personal
        data to analyze, predict, and finally, determine our behavior. While this vast surveillance architecture has
        indeed been used by governments as a means of control, its unchecked growth is due largely to corporate
        interests. The system's human users are rarely asked to consent, but must instead accept tracking
        as the necessary cost of access to the “free” information we can no longer live without.</p>

      <p><em>Advertising Positions</em> began with “robots”, though with a different agenda. Rather than tracking
        humans, these robots were trained to search the web <em>as if</em> they were human, following specific
        profiles they were assigned (age, gender, location, interests, etc). Each trained robot was released on the web,
        driving a modified version of the Chrome browser, to periodically visit sites that it “liked”, and to click on
        links it chose, then bringing it to additional sites. This process continued over several weeks as the robots
        collected and saved each ad they were served.</p>

      <p>The specific ads shown on websites are determined by real-time auctions, which occur within the time it takes the page to
        load, in which the robot's growing data profile is sold to the highest corporate bidder, who then injects one or
        more ads into the page content. The robot, rather than using these ads to make purchases, instead uses each as
        the texture for a single polygon on its virtual mesh body. The training period concludes when the robot’s new
        skin was complete.</p>

      <p>
        In current iterations of the project, human volunteers are 3d-scanned in our laboratory and given custom
        software to collect the advertisements with which they are targeted over several months of web browsing
        (generally several thousand or more ads). Each ad is then applied to a single polygon on the mesh skin of the 3d
        avatar we create for them, animated according to their specific style of movement.
