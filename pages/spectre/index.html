    <p><strong><em>Spectre, </em></strong>a new interactive installation <em>by Bill Posters and Daniel Howe<strong>,
        </strong></em>reveals the secrets of the Digital Influence Industry in a cautionary tale of technology,
      democracy and society, curated by algorithms and powered by visitors’ data. Premiering at the <a
        href="https://sheffdocfest.com/articles?tag=alternate_realities" target="_new">Sheffield Doc/Fest Alternate
        Realities</a> exhibition, <em>Spectre</em> leverages the technologies and techniques of the tech giants,
      advertising firms, and political campaign groups to show how our behaviours are being predicted, influenced and
      controlled.</p>

    <p>Revived as ‘deep fake’ avatars, in both the literal and spiritual senses, celebrities including Marcel Duchamp,
      Mark Zuckerberg, Kim Kardashian, Freddy Mercury and more, engage audiences in the affective power of computational
      propaganda, where notions of truth and free will are not to be relied upon.</p>

    <p>The Digital Influence Industry is a burgeoning and largely unregulated sector. Since 2010, political parties and
      governments have spent nearly a billion dollars on the research, development and implementation of psychological
      operations and opinion manipulation techniques that involve social media. In many countries divisive social media
      campaigns have heightened ethnic tensions, revived nationalistic movements, intensified
      political conflict, and even resulted in political crises, while simultaneously weakening public trust in
      journalism, democratic institutions, and electoral outcomes.</p>
    <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-791" src="spectre2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675"

        sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>As Howe says, “In recent years the world has learned of the dangerous new forms of computational propaganda
      currently employed by social media platforms, the ad industry, and political consultancies like Cambridge
      Analytica. In Spectre we used many of the same techniques – data analytics, behavioural profiling, sentiment
      analysis, deep-learning – to enable audiences to experience the inner workings of this secret digital influence
      industry. We wanted users to feel what is at stake when the data taken from us in countless everyday actions is
      used in unexpected and dangerous ways.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-792" src="spectre3.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675"
        srcset="spectre3.jpg 1200w, Twitter_3-300x169.jpg 300w, Twitter_3-768x432.jpg 768w, Twitter_3-1024x576.jpg 1024w"
        sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Posters continues:  “The fact that citizen data  – including intimate knowledge on political leanings, sexuality,
      psychological traits and personality – are made available to the highest bidder shows that the digital influence
      industry and its associated architectures pose a risk not only to individual human rights but to our democracies
      at large... History has demonstrated that we can’t have democracy without privacy.”</p>

    <p>Dr. Ben-Ami, co-founder of CannyAI, says: “We are excited to collaborate on <em>Spectre</em> in exploring the
      influence Artificial Intelligence will have on our society. We hope to reveal to audiences what can already be
      achieved today,
      and give a glimpse into how AI will change everything we know about storytelling, content creation, and human
      interaction.”</p>

    <p>Vesselin Popov, Executive Director of the Cambridge Psychometrics Centre says: “It has never been more important
      to engage in open debate regarding the malign impact of AI, social media and big tech on democracy; projects like
      <em>Spectre</em> can provide tremendous value in engaging and surprising new audiences, creating an imperative for
      self-reflection and a manifesto for the kind of authenticity or integrity that is so often lacking from our
      political institutions.”</p>

    <p><strong><em>Spectre</em></strong> was the winner of the <a
