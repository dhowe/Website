When the machine lands on sensitive words, such as those disallowed by China's Great Firewall (or those now illegal in Hong Kong), a break occurs and the machine jumps from traditional to simplified.<!--br/><br/>In order to realize the work, extensive research was required into the potential decompositions of simplified and traditional Chinese characters, and on the various measures of distance between them, the latter leading to a novel algorithm for sinographic edit distance.

    "longdesc": "<i>Open.Ended</i> is an interactive three-dimensional poem experienced through the interplay of shifting geometric surfaces. Verses appear on the faces of separate translucent cubes nested within one another. The reader manipulates a controller or touch-screen to bring stanzas on different surfaces into view. As cubes, faces, and layers are revealed, dynamically updating lines of text move in and out of focus. The structure of the poem facilitates a multiplicity of readings: from single verses on cube faces, to sequential verses across faces, to juxtapositions of verses across multiple cubes. Meaning is constructed actively through collaboration between reader, author, and mediated work. An audio track of the authors' layered voices extends the experience, enveloping the reader in the atmosphere of the poem.",
